Vi was created in 1976 and, up until then, some of the most popular editors, like "qed", would appear completely alien to us today.

Because of this, when Vi was being written, the movement keys were mapped to h, j, k, and l, the same movement keys used in Vim to this day. Indeed the vast majority of decisions that lead to the creation of Vi were purely due to the constraints of computers at the time.  Thus it is with some humor to remember that even Bill Joy, the guy who created Vi, jokes that \"People don't know that Vi was written for a world that doesn't exist anymore.\" It is a testament to the software that it has remained one of the most celebrated programs ever written and amongst the most used editors in the world to this day, over 40 years later."),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"module__objectives"},"Vim is fast"),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"module__text"},"As web development continues to evolve, the size of projects are becoming orders of magnitude larger.

Yet, the irony is that even the best rated editors like VScode, Atom, Sublime, do not even approach what Vim can do before we begin adding our own custom plugins, macros and key mappings. For instance, every programmer is well acquainted with their clipboard for copying and pasting code. Vim has the equivalent of nearly 40 clipboards (registries) which can append text to them at any point in time. This means that you can scan down your code line by line and grab specific lines related to a function you wish to refactor to be independent of its current function and just continue adding them to the same registry, and then paste it all at once to the new code block. If that doesn't sound cool to you, maybe it's programmable built-in spell checker will get your attention, decreasing the amount of time you spend copying and pasting text back and forth between your html and a word document as you spell check website content for potentially embarrassing typos.

Vim on the other hand allows the use of modes to differentiate between when we are performing operations, typing, or selecting. If we wished to delete a word, we simply type "dw", if we wish to delete 2 words, we type "2dw". An entire line of code, "dd", or perhaps an entire block of code, "dap".
